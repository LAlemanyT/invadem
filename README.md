# invadem
The basis of this project was a university assignment, however it was expanded to include extra features I wanted.

It is a simple "Space Invaders" clone featuring progressively harder gameplay, sound and a 2 player mode.

# How to run
simply use the "gradle build" and "gradle run" commands to run the program

# Instructions

    - Player 1 moves with the arrow keys and fires with space.

    - 2 Player mode can be activated or deactivated by pressing tab at any time.

    - When active, player 2 moves with the a and d keys and fires with w.

    - Each player starts with 3 lives but can get an extra life every 20,000 points.
    
# Testing
Testing consists of a series of unit tests present in the repository aimed at ensuring correct behaviour in individual methods.
